# bommidi_AIT580
This is the Assignment 3 for AIT580.

  My name is BOMMIDI SOHAN from India, I am currently in my first semester pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Data Analytics Engineering. I have completed my Under Graduation from Amrita University with Computer Science as my major. 
  Before joining GMU, I worked as a Software Engineer in Cerner Corporation for 1 year 8 months, where I have worked on basics of Ruby on Rails, React JS and C# for designing the APIs for the healthcare applications. 
  I have taken courses like Big data ,SQL, Machine Learning and Image Processing during my Undergraduate program. My goal for taking this course is to understand what exactly Big data actually means and how the data is being transformed into required information and how we are able to use the information.
