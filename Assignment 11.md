# **a. Distortion in a Visualization**

In a website named 'The Richest Cities in the US' designed in 'howmuch.com' from https://howmuch.net/articles/richest-cities-in-the-us/, the visualization called '*Visualizing the Richest Cities in the US*' fails to convey the data in visualisation to the user due to the missing data in the graph. When it says the richest cities it could have mentioned economy of all the cities and then compare the data.

There are 2 flaws in this:-
- **Flaw-1** -  It does not help in understanding clearly due to the ** missing data of all the cities**, which misleads the readers
    **Sol** - One solution to this is, plotting the data points clearly in Bar Graph view by adding all the economy of all the cities and then compare. 


# **b. Misleading Interpretation**

In a Website posted in 'howmuch.com' at https://howmuch.net/articles/richest-cities-in-the-us/
is the comparison of richest cities in USA. A proper map with exact information of cities will interpret the map in a better way .

Below is the flaw elaborated:- 

- **Flaw** -**From the map we can obverse that there are few missing values ** 
    **Sol**- The map contains plotted points, but the information for each data point is not displayed, and the legend of the points misleads the information; instead, all points are appropriately plotted on the map, and data must be inserted. Because When we read the article, we find that it discusses the richest cities in the United States, however when it states richest, it would have been great if they included statistics from all of the cities. This has to be discovered and dealt with.
